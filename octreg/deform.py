"""§6 Smooth deformation: a small displacement field on top of the affine of §1-5, fitted to two kinds of label-free local
evidence, with its smoothness chosen by held-out error (docs/METHOD.md §6).

Convention. The field u is in mm along the MRI world axes and is defined at MRI points x: the OCT content that belongs at x sits
at x + u(x) in the affinely registered OCT, so warped_OCT(x) = OCT_affine(x + u(x)) = OCT(T^-1 (x + u(x))), T the affine (OCT
world -> MRI world). It is a pull-back field on the MRI base grid; T is not changed and the field is not inverted anywhere.

Everything runs on the MRI base grid, onto which the OCT and its specimen mask are resampled through T (mask kept above INSIDE).
Evidence, measured on that volume:
  interior  block matches of the contrast-free structure feature of the two volumes, over the blocks with at least 70 % of
            their volume inside both masks eroded by Params.df_erode_mm (octreg.blockmatch): centres W [N, 3] and
            displacements D [N, 3] (mm, world); matches longer than the search range df_range_mm are dropped, the range
            being per axis.
  boundary  points of the MRI foreground surface (surface) with outward unit normals, and the offset between the surface edges
            of the two volumes along each normal (edge_offsets: the steepest fall of the intensity going outwards, found in the
            same way in the MRI and in the OCT, so that what the rule does to an edge cancels): points P [M, 3], normals n
            [M, 3], offsets delta [M] (mm; > 0: the OCT surface lies outside the MRI surface). The edge, not the bright rim of
            the OCT: the rim is a layer below the surface, its ridge lies inside the surface by half its thickness. Only
            profiles with exactly one prominent fall are used, so faces crossed by section stripes drop out without any
            knowledge of the sectioning axis. And only points with an interior match within Params.df_support_mm: where the
            inside of the two volumes does not correspond (torn or missing tissue, a bubble), an edge nearby is not evidence of
            a deformation, and the field stays at what its neighbourhood supports.
Model (Lattice, fit): displacements c on a regular control lattice of spacing Params.df_grid_mm over the bounding box of the MRI
grid, trilinear in between. Regularised least squares: rows N(W) c = D, rows n . (N(P) c) = delta weighted by sqrt(3 N / M) so
that both kinds carry the same total weight, a membrane penalty lam (first differences of c along the lattice axes)^2, a ridge
row RIDGE c, and HUBER_ROUNDS solutions re-weighted by the Huber rule (Params.df_huber_mm) on both residual types.
Model choice (choose): the field has to stay plausible for fixed tissue, so its strain (largest first difference of c / spacing)
stays below Params.df_max_strain, and lam is the smallest weight in LAM_RANGE whose fit keeps that limit (smallest_lam,
bisection in log lam), the most flexible field the limit allows. The field is accepted only when it predicts evidence it was
not fitted to: over FOLDS spatial folds (cells of FOLD_MM) the held-out median interior error plus the held-out median boundary
error (held_out) must fall below Params.df_gain x the same score of no deformation. Without that gain, when no weight in
LAM_RANGE keeps the strain limit, or with too little evidence, there is no deformation (status 'not_supported', zero field).
The evidence is measured once and the field fitted once; both kinds are measured again on the warped OCT for the read-outs.
