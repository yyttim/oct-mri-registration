"""octreg: label-free affine registration of a serial-sectioning OCT block to an ex-vivo MRI cropped around it, with a small
smooth deformation on top.

1. Specimen mask from isotropic texture: agarose has the intensity of tissue, but its artefacts are anisotropic.
2. One soft two-class map for both modalities, scored together with the specimen outline. The contrast polarity is the sign of
   the two-class score.
3. FFT orientation search inside the MRI crop.
4. One affine refinement per search pose under a scale and shear prior.
5. Fine-structure refinement of the best pose by normalised gradient fields.
6. A smooth displacement field on top of the affine, fitted to interior block matches and surface-edge offsets, as flexible
   as a strain limit allows. Not applied without a held-out gain.

Method constants are in octreg.params.Params (numerical guards and fixed rule literals are documented where they are used).
Python use: `from octreg.register import register, apply, qc`; command line: `octreg register`, `octreg apply`, `octreg qc`.
