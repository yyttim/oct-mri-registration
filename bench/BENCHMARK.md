# Benchmark: the I58 brainstem pair

octreg registered the two original files as given (OCT 1457x2013x1595 at 20 um, header LPI; MRI crop 343x489x495 at 0.08 mm, header RIA) with `octreg register OCT MRI -o OUT` and default parameters (Params hash 892a1f3b4fd6f7ed). The pair has no labels, so every number here is label-free. The numbers are read from the run's result.json and eval.json and from ablations.json (copies in bench/results/I58/). Commands: `python bench/run_i58.py` (see bench/README.md).

## Visual result

The result is judged by visual inspection of the overlays (docs/METHOD.md, "Evaluation"). The numbers below support that judgement. The figures of the I58 pair are drawn locally by the bench scripts and are not published.

fig_handedness_I58.png (bench/compose_pair.py) shows planes through the centroid of the specimen mask, normal to each OCT array axis: the OCT, then for the result and for the best pose of the other handedness (ablation A8, also refined by §5) the MRI through the transform (inverted inside its foreground, polarity -1) and a 2 mm checkerboard. The mirrored pose fits the outline better (S_outline 0.6867 against 0.6277) and has the lower §4 loss (L 0.7035 against 0.7192), but its fine structure matches less (F 0.078 against 0.103).

qc.png of the run shows the MRI foreground through the transform (red) and the OCT specimen mask (cyan) in the fourth column, and qc_montage.png shows four planes per axis.

qc_deform.png of the run shows the MRI, the OCT through the affine, the OCT through the affine and the smooth field of §6, and the magnitude of that field, on three planes with the outline of the MRI foreground. The field is 0.22 mm in the median and 1.16 mm at most.

The raw-data frame check passes. The pair has no labels, so none of these numbers is a success criterion.

## Ablations

Each variant is the method with one explicit change, run from the same preprocessed grids (one per OCT mask source). Pose change is against base (the method through the same driver), as the mean over the points of the base specimen mask and the mean and max over the 8 corners of the OCT array. The boundary agreement uses the base masks for every variant, so it reflects the pose only. The smooth deformation (§6) leaves the pose alone, so no variant runs it: 'no §6' would be base with the identical pose, and its read-outs are the 'before' residuals in the Main result table above.

Driver check: base through bench/ablate.py lies 0.00 mm (corners max 0.00 mm) from the CLI run.

Deletion rule: a step goes when removing it moves the pose by at most 0.5 mm (mean over the specimen-mask points; the §4 pose for steps of §1-4, the final pose for §5), changes no other metric beyond noise, and no test outside this pair shows it load bearing. Removing MRI flattening (A1, 0.10 mm), the scale clamp (A6c, 0.00 mm) or the one-sided outline (A10, 0.15 mm) stays within 0.5 mm, and the reason for keeping each is in docs/METHOD.md after the ablation table. Removing per-plane hole filling (A0c, 0.99 mm), OCT flattening (A2, 1.07 mm), the two-class maps (A4, 0.58 mm), the scale prior (A6, 15.87 mm), the outline term (A9, 19.65 mm) or the fine-structure refinement (A12, 1.50 mm) moves the pose further.

### Removed steps

Copied from the first ablation run, whose base still had the section-stripe flat field and the ladder (and the earlier score, two-class maps under an overlap gate), so pose changes in these rows are against that base. Removing either step moved the pose by less than the 0.5 mm deletion threshold and both were deleted.

## Reading

Every variant except A12 ends with §5 on its own best pose; the table gives the change of the pose after §4 against the base's §4 pose and of the final pose against the base. All distances below are block-corner means.

A specimen mask rather than the intensity foreground, the outline term, the polarity rule, the scale prior and the handedness decide this pair. With the intensity-threshold OCT mask (A0, 29.5 cm3 against 19.2 cm3), without the outline term (A9), with the polarity forced to +1 (A5+1) or without the scale prior (A6) the block turns over, 36 to 43 mm from the result, and the mirrored OCT (A8) lies 30 mm away; §5, which only refines, does not bring any of them back. Without the scale prior S rises to 0.5013 (§4 pose) while the final OCT shrinks to 0.51-0.57 of its length along all three axes. The mirrored pose has the lower §4 loss but the lower F (0.078 against 0.103).

§5 (A12) moves the result by 2.36 mm (1.50 mm over the specimen, 5.3 degrees). OCT flattening off (A2, 2.41 mm after §4), holes filled in 3-D only (A0c, 2.19), standardised intensities (A4, 0.81) and the two-sided outline (A10, 0.23) all change the §4 pose, and §5 settles them to 0.00-0.17 mm. MRI flattening off (A1) moves the §4 pose by 0.18 mm and the final pose by 0.00 mm, within the deletion rule, and is kept for the reason given in docs/METHOD.md after the ablation table.

With a cut face simulated by removing the specimen mask beyond 70 % of its extent along OCT axis 1 and keeping the data there as embedding, the method moves 0.40 mm after §4 and 0.11 mm after §5 (A11), while the two-sided outline moves 4.68 mm and still 3.87 mm after §5 (A11b): §5 does not replace the one-sided outline for a roughly cropped MRI.

The "previous run" in the table is release 1.0, and 1.1 gives the same affine: 0.003 mm at the block corners, which is float noise between two runs, and the same boundary agreement, since §1-5 did not change. A second §6 paragraph and the §6 ablations are in docs/METHOD.md. The section-stripe flat field and the refinement ladder were removed after the first ablation run: switching off the flat field moved that run's pose by 0.15 mm (A3), and one affine refinement from every search pose gave the ladder's pose to within 0.0015 mm (A7).
